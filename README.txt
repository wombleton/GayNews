GayNews

In 2012, New Zealand's Prime Minister was joking with a DJ and said "You're munted mate.
You're never going to make it. You've got that gay red top on."  He later clarified that
meant "weird", and didn't intend it to be an insult. November 9 was declared "Red Gay
Shirt Day", got its own hashtag (#RedGayShirtDay), and everyone came to work dressed in a
red shirt.

It set me thinking about how words carry connotations and legacies. My first instinct was
to manually rewrite headlines from a newspaper to add "gay" before every noun.  Then I
thought, "why do something manually when I can automate it?"  This is the result.

I used:

 * Google Feed API https://developers.google.com/feed/

Many thanks to Rob Coup (@amatix) for his help getting the script and noscript locations
and timing right.
